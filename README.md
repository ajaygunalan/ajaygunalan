### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



A biomedical roboticist with 3 years of experience in software development. I love to learn across several disciplines and support others in a diverse team to develop medical devices. The joy of our loved one staying with us for a few more moments inspires & excites me to provide quality healthcare at an affordable cost to all life
